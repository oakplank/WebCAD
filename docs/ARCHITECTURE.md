# WebCAD Architecture Documentation

## Overview
WebCAD is a browser-based CAD application built with React, Three.js, and TypeScript. It follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns between UI, business logic, and state management.

## Core Architecture Components

### Frontend Stack
- React: UI framework
- Three.js: 3D rendering engine
- TypeScript: Static typing
- Zustand: State management
- Emotion: Styled components
- Vite: Build tool

### State Management
The application uses Zustand for state management, split into multiple stores:
- SceneStore: 3D scene state
- WorkplaneStore: Workplane management
- SettingsStore: Application settings
- ModifyStore: Modification operations

### File System
- Supports GLB import/export
- File operations handled by FileService
- Blob-based file handling
- Async file processing

### Viewport System
- React Three Fiber integration
- Custom camera controls
- Workplane management
- Object transformation handlers

## Data Flow
1. User interactions trigger UI components
2. Components dispatch actions to stores
3. Stores update state and trigger re-renders
4. Three.js scene updates reflect state changes

## Performance Considerations
- WebGL optimization
- Geometry instancing
- Lazy loading for large models
- Efficient state updates

## Security Considerations
- Input validation for file imports
- Sanitization of user inputs
- Access control for operations
- Secure file handling

## Error Handling
- Graceful degradation
- User feedback
- Error boundaries
- Logging system

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for utilities
- Component testing
- Integration testing
- Performance testing

## Build and Deployment
- Development environment setup
- Production build optimization
- Asset optimization
- Deployment pipeline
